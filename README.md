## What is Kubeflow Dashboard?

Key features of Kubeflow Dashboard include:

- Access to the [web interfaces](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/central-dash/overview/#navigation) of Kubeflow components.
- Authorization using [Kubeflow Profiles](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/central-dash/profiles/) and Kubernetes Namespaces.
   - _Note, authentication depends on how you [install](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/installing-kubeflow/#kubeflow-platform) your Kubeflow Platform, and is not directly handled by Kubeflow Dashboard._
- Ability to [Customize](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/central-dash/customize/) and include links to third-party applications.
